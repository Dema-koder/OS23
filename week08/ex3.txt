In this problem, I first allocated 10 MB and si and so were equal to 0. After that, 
I increased the memory allocation to 100 MB and got the same results. However, after I 
started allocating 1024MB = 1GB I saw that si and so were changing. This can be explained 
by the fact that the RAM size was no longer enough and the data had to be uploaded to disk.
