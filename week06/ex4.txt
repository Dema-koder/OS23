The Round Robin (RR) scheduling technique, as compared to the Shortest Job First (SJF) and 
the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) algorithms, is much less efficient. Every already arrived work will 
execute with a decreasing average response time since RR is allocating equal time quantum to each process. 
The tat and wt will be more than those in SJF, which makes it inefficient for lengthy tasks because they will be replaced out frequently.
